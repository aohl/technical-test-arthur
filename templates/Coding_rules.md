# Coding rules

## Naming Conventions

- All functions, variables, structs, unions and enums shall be in snake_case
- Private functions start with an underscore. A brief of the function must be added to the prototyping.
- `#define` constants shall be in all CAPS
- Enum constants shall be in all CAPS
- Variables shall be declared only one per line
- Pointers shall start with the prefix `p_`

You can find an example of applying these rules in the files below:

- [Header file (.h)](./file_template.c)
- [Source file (.c)](./file_template.h)

## Required

- No code redundancy
- No magic numbers
